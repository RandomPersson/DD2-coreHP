A tool for technical Dungeon Defenders II players.  
Calculates core HP at given Onslaught floor as well as simulates its heal stages (relevant in post-wall floors).  

Made to help exploit the "invincible core" bug in our team's 999 push, but ended up not being used.

Fancy colors for coding practice.
